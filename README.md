# Maze Game

Welcome to the Maze Game! This is a simple Python game created using the Turtle graphics library. Your objective in this game is to navigate through a maze, collect blue-colored treasures, and color the whole maze blue while avoiding obstacles.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player character (yellow circle) through the maze.
2. Your goal is to collect the blue treasures (blue circles) scattered throughout the maze.
3. As you collect treasures, the player's gem count will increase.
4. When you collect 5 treasures, the game ends, and you win!
5. Be careful not to collide with red obstacles (red triangles) while navigating the maze.

## Game Features

- The maze consists of walls (black squares), which you cannot pass through.
- Collected treasures turn the maze blue.
- Obstacles move randomly within the maze, so watch out for their unpredictable movements.
